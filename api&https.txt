API is application Programming Interface
API is basically a bridge that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
API uses a specific communication protocol to enable this interaction, such as HTTP/HTTPS for web APIs. It defines how messages are formatted and transmiited between clients(browsers/app) and servers(websites/web services)
HTTP methods:
GET: Used to retrieve data from a server. For example, when you visit a website, your browser sends a GET request to fetch the webpage.
POST: Used to send data to a server to create a new resource.
PUT: Used to update an existing resource on the server with new data.
DELETE: Used to remove a resource from the server.
patch: Used to make partial updates to an existing resource on the server.

Http request structure
Request line(url):
Headers(http method, content type): carries additional information about a request
body(optional) - post

Daniel has built a simple blogging system(football updates) - update title,content,date,image
[DAN-DB(username,password)]...(Built it using PHP)
use a tool/library/framework that is compatible with PHP to build urls(https://daniel.com/api) that in turn these returns a JSON response/structure when requests are made to them.

typical response of api
[
    {
        "title": "update 1",
        "content": "content of update 1",
        "date": "2023-10-01",9.45pm
        "image": "https://daniel.com/images/update1.jpg"
    },
    {
        "title": "update 2",
        "content": "content of update 2",
        "date": "2023-10-02",10.00pm
        "image": "https://daniel.com/images/update2.jpg"
    },
    {   "title": "update 3",
        "content": "content of update 3",
        "date": "2023-10-03",8.30pm
        "image": "https://daniel.com/images/update3.jpg"
    }

API (open/public, private, partnership, composite)
API are for developers
---------------------->>> HTTP requests >>>>API endpoint(URL) >>>>server >>>>database >>>>response(JSON, XML, HTML)>>>client(browser/app)


Fidelis is building a blogging system(football updates) - update title,content,date,image[DAN-DB(username,password)]...(Built it using Python)
Fidelis uses Daniel API to connect to DAN-DB and perform operations like create,read,update,delete blog posts without the database credentials
Fidelis needs to make a request to those urls, get the JSON structures, converts them to his native language structure and get those updates
